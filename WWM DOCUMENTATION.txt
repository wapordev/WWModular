 ----====|| Welcome to the Waporware Modular Documentation! ||====----

 Here is an overview of the contents:
 - The basics
 - Workspace overview
 - Using the tracker
 - Module Descriptions
 - Sampling

 ----====|| THE BASICS ||====----

 How WWModular works:
 
 -- The idea -- 
 In modular synthesis, everything is a signal. There are usually 2 main types, although the distinction
 is purely in their regular use, as they can be used in any way you want. The two types are Audio and CV.
 Audio is a signal that is oscillating extremely fast so it is audible to our ears.
 CV (control voltage, coming from analog hardware) is a signal that is too slow to hear on its own, or even static, but is used to control
 how other modules function, and change the dynamics of your sound.
 
 -- Using wires --
 Modules take input signals through their input ports, to control how they function, and output their result through output ports. 
 In WWModular, module outputs are marked with dark blue ports, and inputs with white ports.
 You can create wires by dragging from an input to an output or vice versa.
 Outputs can send multiple wires to as many inputs as you want, but inputs can only accept 1 wire at a time.
 To remove a wire, drag on it's input side, and release over empty space.
 
 -- Placing and deleting modules --
 To place a module, you right click on empty space and click on one listed in the menu.
 To delete a module, right click on it's surface and click delete from the menu. The mixer module also has options to add or delete rows when right clicking.
 
 -- Recording, exporting, and importing -- 
 Recording audio to desktop can be done by clicking the red circle button at the top.
 Exporting can be done via clicking enter on the module workspace page.
 Importing is done simply by dragging a valid file onto the program (make sure your previous work is saved!).

 -- WARNING --
 The audio can get very loud, so make sure you are listening at safe levels!
 You can change the volume at any time by pressing control and -/=, so if you are unsure, turn it to the lowest volume before listening.
 
 -- Get started --
 To get started, it is recommended that you view the example projects in examples.zip. You can load them by dragging the .p8l files onto the program.
 Load beginner_example.p8l and try to see how it works. The TRI module (which is constantly generating audio) is having it's volume controlled by the X button,
 so when you press X, the volume is turned from off to on and you can hear the audio wave.
 Now try adding an LFO (low frequency oscillator) module, and hooking up it's 'OUT' output to the triangles 'FRQ' (frequency) input.
 When you press X again, you should hear that the frequency is sweeping up and down, and you can see this change visuallized in the
 wires lighting up, and the oscilliscope.
 In this project, the LFO is an example of a Control Voltage, while the TRI is an example of an Audio source.
 Designing synths like this can be a lot of fun, but it isn't very musical, arranging melodies will be covered in the tracker section of the documentation.
 

 ----====|| WORKSPACE OVERVIEW ||====----

 When you load up WWModular, you will see 4 main things:
 - The oscilliscope (in the bottom right corner)
 - The speaker (right above the oscilliscope)
 - The tracker bar (top left corner)
 - The menu bar (top right corner)

 The oscilliscope is simple, it shows you a visualization of whatever sounds the program is generating.
 On the top of it, you can see a CPU number showing you how intensive your patch is. Generally keeping it below ~0.8-0.9 is a good idea.

 Next, the speaker; it will send anything it recieves from it's "INP" input, and play it as sound.
 Sounds will not play on their own without being connected to the speaker.
 It also has a "SPD" which controls the speed of the tracker.

 Then, the tracker bar. It has 6 pairs of outputs for each channel on the tracker, T1-6, and their corresponding "GAT" outputs.
 The outputs labeled with "T" are for note frequencies, typically you would connect these to inputs labeled "FRQ" to control module frequencies, 
 but like any other signal, it can be used to control anything you want. The "GAT" outputs below send either min or max signals depending whether
 there are notes being played on the corresponding channel; you can think of this like telling modules whether notes are on or off.
 If the channel is in "GAT" mode, then this will send a signal for as long as a note, including any immediately following, is played.
 If it's in "TRG" mode, then it will send a trigger signal, that is on only for one frame, and repeats even on consecutive notes.
 Finally, at the bottom there is "X" and "Z" outputs, which send an on or off signal when you press those keys in patch mode. This can be useful
 to test instruments without having to make a sequence on the tracker.\

 Finally there is the menu bar. There are 4 buttons here, being Record, Loop mode, Play, and Tracker/Patch Mode Toggle.
 The first button will start a audio recording, and save it to your desktop when you click it again.
 The second changes how the pages on the sequencer are played; right arrow being forward, left arrow being backwards, and looping arrow being looped.
 These can be useful for testing, or for extra performance capabilities when recording.
 The third button is used to start or stop the tracker.
 The fourth button switches back and forth between the patch mode and the tracker mode.

 ----====|| USING THE TRACKER ||====----
 
 By clicking the button on the very top right, you gain access to the tracker, this is where you can arrange notes and melodies.
 On the top right are buttons for tracker controls.
 
 - OC-/+ Go down or up an octave
 - PG-/+ Delete or add a page
 - PG</> Go left or right a page

 In the middle you can see the tracker itself.
 Each column represents a track, there are 6 tracks that you can independently arrange for.
 Each row represents a step that the tracker will go through, at a speed determined by the Output module's SPD input.
 You can navigate through this table with the arrow keys, and input notes by using your keyboard.
 The keyboard is laid out like a piano, the Z key is the note C, with the keys to the right going up the white notes, and the row of keys above it being the black notes.
 This layout repeats on the two rows above, only an octave higher.
 Pressing enter will enter an empty space *before* the highlighted position, and pressing delete will delete a note before the highlighted position.

 When you press play, the tracker will go through each page, and play all the notes in each track.
 The note frequencies will be sent to the T1-T6 outputs on the module workspace, and their gates (on or off signal of when they are playing) to the corressponding GAT outputs.
 You can use the frequencies to control synth's frequencies (or anything else really), and the GAT to control volumes, ADSR, or to trigger samplers, or synth+ modules.

 (Do not worry about this part as a beginner)
 At the bottom of each column is a button to switch to either GAT(gate) or TRG(trigger) mode.
 In gate mode, an on or off signal is outputted on the corresponding track's GAT output on the module workspace, for as long as a note is being played.
 In trigger mode, it sends out an extremely short pulse only at the start of a note. Using the HOLD module, this can be extended to any length you want,
 to make notes trigger continually even when there is no gap between them.

 This module generates a constant square/pulse wave at the inputted frequency. 
 Additionally, the length of this pulse can be determined via the LEN input.
 A LEN at the default value in the middle will mean it's at max signal 50% of the time, and minimum 50% of the time (regular square wave).
 A max signal LEN will mean it's at the max signal 100% of the time (a constant signal at any level is inaudible), and vice versa for a minimum signal LEN.

 |________________/

 This module generates a specified wave, and then passes it through an internal low pass filter that rises and falls with the specified attack and release.
 Since having a lowpass filter at the minimum frequency means cutting out all sound, this module does not constantly run like the other synths.
 The functionality of this synth, and more, can be easily recreated with other modules, but in a larger space.

 INPUTS
 - FRQ, the frequency of the wave
 - WAV, sweeps through multiple different wave option, from SIN->TRI->SAW->SQUARE, positions in between are mixed linearly
 - ATK, controls the attack of the internal filter
 - REL, controls the release of the internal filter
 - RES, controls the resonance of the internal filter
 - GAT, tells the filter to open or close

 | DELAY          |
 | [] INP  [] OUT |
 | [] LEN         |
 |________________/

 This module will delay the incoming signal by the specified length. An echo can easily be created with this method:
 An audio signal goes into a mixer, and the mixer's output goes to a delay.
 The delays output goes into the same mixer, but at a decreased volume.
 The output of the mixer is your final wave.
 The result of this is that the audio signal first goes through the mixer directly, while also being delayed. Once the delay is done, it gets sent to the mixer
 again but at a lower volume. The feedback loop of this means that the audio signal will play several times while getting quieter.

 INPUTS
 - INP, the input signal
 - LEN, the length of the delay

 OUTPUTS
 - OUT, the outputted signal

 ----====|| SAMPLING ||====----

 -- HOW TO GENERATE SAMPLES --

 > Go to https://bikibird.itch.io/defy
 > Upload your audio file
 > Select "Unsigned 8-bit PCM" under the format drop-down menu
 > Optionally select Trim Leading Silence, or Apply Antialiasing Filter (which attempts to make the sound closer to the original when changing the bitrate/depth)
 > Download the file, open, and add "wmsa" to the beggining, with no spaces, tabs or new lines
 
 -- IMPORTING SAMPLES --
 
 Drag your .pcm onto the program, doing so will put the dragged sample into slots 1-8 sequentially.
 
 -- USAGE --
 
 See the examples folder in examples.zip for examples of use, or the samples folder for premade samples, and more in depth instructions.
 Refer to the sample module description for input values.
