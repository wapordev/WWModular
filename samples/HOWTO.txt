== HOW TO GENERATE SAMPLES ==

> Go to https://bikibird.itch.io/defy
> Upload your audio file
> Select "Unsigned 8-bit PCM" under the format drop-down menu
> Optionally select Trim Leading Silence, or Apply Antialiasing Filter (which attempts to make the sound closer to the original when changing the bitrate/depth)

== HOW TO USE SAMPLES ==

> In patch mode, press Enter and select "manage samples" from the menu.
> Drag your .pcm file onto any of the 8 slots; the sample should be drawn in green.
> On the sample module use a knob or tracker output on the first input to control which slot you are playing from
> The tracker notes corresponding to samples slots are, in order: C1, C2, C3, G#3, C4, E4, G#4, A#4, as can be seen in the sample example project
> The samplers frequency starts at C2, so for example if you send in C1 as the frequency it will be at half speed, and C3 double speed

== EXAMPLES ==

> Look at sampled_drums_example, sampled_instrument_example, or sampler_example to see this in use
> For sampling drums, you'll likely want this setup:
  - Tracker channel (T1-T6) going in to "smp" to control the sample slot
  - Tracker gate (gat under T1-T6) going in to "gat" to control starting samples
  - A knob turned fully to the right going into "lup", making it so the samples don't loop on their own
  - A knob going into freq for a fixed frequency
  - Then by putting the notes listed in 'how to use samples' in your tracker channel, you will trigger sample slots 1-8 to play a one-shot sample at a controllable frequency
> For sampling instruments:
  - Make sure your initial sample can cleanly loop, or works as a one-shot sample (editing in a program like audacity can help)
  - Send a knob in to "smp" to choose which slot to use (or optionally switch between multiple with a seperate track like for drums)
  - Send a tracker gate corresponding to your sample frequency channel to "gat" if you are using one-shots
  - Send a knob to "lup" either fully right for one-shot, or anywhere in between to go from looping 1% to 100% of the sample
  - Send a tracker channel to "frq" to control the frequency, and input notes on the tracker to play a melody
  - If you are using a looped sample, you will need to mix the sample output with an adsr that is being controlled by your tracker gate to turn it off and on
